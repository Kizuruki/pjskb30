# KIZUB30

This is a fork of auburnsummer's tool for manually creating "b30" ("best 30")
images solely using Kizuruki's custom Project Sekai charts on Sonolus / Chart
Cyanvas.

A b30 image shows a player's best 30 scores. It's a quick way to summarize your
best achievements.

Big thanks to auburnsummer for making this possible.
